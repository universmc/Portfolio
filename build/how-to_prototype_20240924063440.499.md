Let's get this done! To make a useful How-To guide, I need some more information. 

Please tell me:

* **What kind of prototype are we talking about?** 
    * Is it a physical product prototype (like a toy or gadget)?
    * A software prototype (like a website or app)?
    * A business model prototype (like a lean canvas)?
    * Something else entirely?
* **What is the purpose of this prototype?**
    * Is it to test a specific feature?
    * To get feedback on the overall design?
    * To demonstrate the concept to investors?
* **Who is the target audience for this guide?**
    * Are they beginners who have never prototyped before?
    * Experienced makers looking for a specific technique?
    * A team of developers who need to understand the prototype's functionality?

Once I have this information, I can create a detailed and helpful How-To guide tailored to your needs.
